	  <p>This site is constructed for academic purpose. The overall goal of this project is to collect training data for a facial feature evaluation system. You, as a user help immensely with this otherwise daunting and difficult data compilation task. 
		Voting
		You are presented with two images; your objective is to judge which image you find most appealing. If you cannot decide, you can use the “tie” option. 
		Reporting
		If either of the images does not contain a singular face of the correct gender, please report it, so we can have it removed.
		Uploading
		You can upload up to 9 images of your own and track their progress on the site. Please only upload images that contains a singular non obstructed face.
